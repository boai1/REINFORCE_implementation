# REINFORCE_implementation

## Task 
This project implements the following algorithms from scratch:
- REINFORCE
- Actor-critic with:
  - Bootstrapping

  - Baseline subtraction
  
  - Bootstrapping + baseline subtraction
  
  
For the implementation, the project uses python with Tensorflow.

## Goal
The goal of this project is to implement and investigate the 4 techniques. Questions that should be answered are:

- Do the policy gradients used by REINFORCE indeed suffer from high-variance?
- What is the effect of bootstrapping and baseline subtraction, and their combination, within the actorcritic
framework on on the variance of the policy gradients?
- How do these techniques compare in terms of performance?
